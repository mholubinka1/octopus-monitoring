# Grafana Queries

One SQL block per panel, documenting the live dashboard. Reconciled directly against [`grafana/dashboard.json`](../dashboard.json) — a full export of the dashboard's JSON model — rather than against the specs, so this file now describes what's actually deployed, not just what was planned. Re-sync both files together whenever the dashboard changes; this doc and the JSON export are meant to never drift apart again.

**Status**: `agile_forecast` and `cost_forecast` are confirmed live and in use (no longer spec-only) — `cost_forecast` backs both the Billing Period Progress panel and the `billing_period_start`/`billing_period_end` dashboard variables; `agile_forecast` backs Agile Prices and the Cheapest Time Window table. The tariff-comparison feature these queries originally assumed was dropped entirely and never came back. The Gas row and Health row documented in earlier revisions of this file are **no longer part of the dashboard** — see the callout at the bottom of this file before assuming that was intentional.

Three Grafana dashboard variables are defined (`templating.list` in the JSON):

- `${region}` — the account's GSP region code (see **Region Code / GSP** in `.agent-docs/context.md`). Query: `SELECT DISTINCT region FROM product_rate;`
- `${billing_period_start}` / `${billing_period_end}` — pulled live from the most recent `cost_forecast` row (`ORDER BY computed_at DESC LIMIT 1`), formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`. Not consumed by any panel query — they're interpolated directly into the **Billing Period Progress** panel's title so the billing window is visible without a separate table panel.

**Dashboard-level time range**: `from: now-3h`, `to: now+48h`, `refresh: 30m`. This is what actually gives the Agile Prices panel its forward lookahead — not a panel-level `timeFrom`/`timeShift` override (Grafana's per-panel relative-time override can only push the *start* earlier; it always hardcodes the end to literal "now", so it structurally cannot show forecast data past the current moment). Setting the dashboard's own default range to end at `now+48h` sidesteps that limitation entirely, since the ceiling only applies to panel-level overrides, not the dashboard's own top-level range. Any panel that needs a *different, fixed* window from this shared default carries its own `timeFrom`/`timeShift` (documented per panel below).

**Note on the lookahead figure**: earlier in this dashboard's design, the explicit requirement was a 72-hour Agile Prices lookahead. The live JSON now has `to: now+48h`, not `+72h`. This may be a deliberate later adjustment made directly in Grafana, or an unintended regression from some other edit — worth confirming which before treating 48h as the final answer. The Cheapest Time Window table's `5days` column still independently reaches 5 days out via `agile_forecast` regardless of this dashboard-level setting, since that panel is a Table with no time axis. (Its middle column was renamed `72hrs` → `3days` for this reason — the old label implied a specific hour-count no longer aligned with the dashboard's own 48h window; see that panel below.)

**Datasource portability fixed**: this export uses Grafana's "export for sharing externally" format — every panel references the datasource as `${DS_MYSQL}` (an `__inputs`-declared placeholder), not a hardcoded UID. Earlier exports hardcoded the literal datasource UID (`aftel9qlylts0e`), which would have broken on any Grafana instance where that UID didn't already exist (e.g. after a full rebuild where the MySQL datasource gets re-added with a new random UID, since it's not provisioned via YAML). Importing this JSON now prompts for a datasource mapping instead of silently failing. Dashboard `uid` is now `afu5ghhf1e29sb`, `version: 19`.

## Schema assumed

```text
consumption               (existing) id, energy, period_from, period_to, raw_value, unit, est_kwh
agreement                 (existing) id, energy, product_code, tariff_code, valid_from, valid_to
product                   (existing) product_code PK, display_name, direction

daily_consumption_summary (existing) energy, date PK(energy, date), total_kwh
agile_forecast             (live) id, region, period_from, period_to, forecast_unit_rate, fetched_at
cost_forecast               (live) id, billing_period_start, billing_period_end, actual_cost_to_date,
                                    projected_total_cost, computed_at
```

`agile_forecast` caches the raw half-hourly AgilePredict response (real 14-day forecast only) for charting. `cost_forecast` is the billing-period-level summary the app computes once daily (actual cost so far + full-period projection, using tiled forecast data internally beyond day 14 — that tiling isn't persisted point-by-point, only the summary is).

**Join convention — half-open windows only.** Any query joining `consumption` to `product_rate` or `agreement` on a `valid_from`/`valid_to` window must use a half-open range: `c.period_from >= valid_from AND c.period_from < COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')`. Never `BETWEEN valid_from AND COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')` (inclusive on both ends) — `consumption.period_from` sits on the exact same half-hourly grid as these windows, and adjacent windows are back-to-back (one row's `valid_to` equals the next row's `valid_from`), so an inclusive-both-ends join matches a consumption row against *two* rate rows instead of one, silently doubling every `SUM(est_kwh * unit_rate)` in the query. Confirmed live: before the fix, the Yesterday's Cost panel showed £6.01 — roughly double the £3.19 the corrected query returns for the same day (the official Octopus app showed £3.25 for that day; that residual gap turned out to be a second, distinct bug — see the local-time convention below and issue #434 for the join-doubling investigation).

**`product_rate` join performance — use a correlated subquery, not a range predicate.** The half-open range predicate above is correct but, against `product_rate` specifically, is a performance trap: MariaDB cannot turn a two-sided open range (`valid_from <= X AND X < valid_to`) into an indexed seek against the composite index `(product_code, region, valid_from, valid_to)`, since it can't know in advance that the windows are non-overlapping. It falls back to a Block Nested Loop join — a full scan of both `consumption` and `product_rate` compared row-by-row. Confirmed live against production (4,199 `consumption` rows × 37,075 `product_rate` rows): a range-predicate join against this table took **88.9s** (`EXPLAIN` showed `type: ALL` on both tables, even with the index available as a `possible_key`). Rewritten as a correlated subquery — "find the single most-recent `product_rate` row with `valid_from <= X`, `ORDER BY valid_from DESC LIMIT 1`" — the same index supports an actual indexed descent (`EXPLAIN` shows `eq_ref`, 1 row), and the same query returned the same values (row-for-row verified) in **11.8s**. Every panel joining `consumption` to `product_rate` uses this form:

```sql
JOIN product_rate pr
  ON pr.id = (
    SELECT pr2.id FROM product_rate pr2
    WHERE pr2.product_code = a.product_code
      AND pr2.region = '${region}'
      AND pr2.valid_from <= c.period_from
    ORDER BY pr2.valid_from DESC
    LIMIT 1
  )
```

instead of the `valid_from`/`valid_to` range-predicate join. This doesn't apply to the `agreement` join (only 7 rows in production — a full scan there is cheap regardless), nor to Agile Prices or the Cheapest Time Window table (both query `product_rate` directly by its own `valid_from`, no interval join against it). Every panel joining `consumption` to `product_rate` now uses this form — `Yesterday's Cost (Electricity)` and `Latest Consumption` (query B) both previously used the slow range-predicate form and have since been fixed.

**Row 2 lookback windows are capped at the retention window (45 days), not 90 days or 12 weeks.** No pruning job actually deletes old `consumption` rows yet (see **Retention Window** in `.agent-docs/context.md`) — the real reason the table is short-lived is that `retention_days` (45) bounds the Startup Backfill's lookback, so the app never fetches more than 45 days of history from Octopus at once. Any query with a longer lookback than that silently returns less data than it appears to ask for, not an error. Panels below that read raw `consumption` are written with a 45-day window for this reason. Monthly Total Consumption and the Year-on-Year panel read `daily_consumption_summary` instead (exempt from this cap) since they only need daily kWh totals.

**Local-time convention — group and label by Europe/London, not raw UTC.** `period_from` is stored as true UTC. Any query that groups or labels by calendar day (`DATE(...)`) or hour-of-day (`HOUR(...)`, `DAYNAME(...)`) must first convert to local time: `CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')`. During BST this shifts the effective day/hour boundary back by an hour from raw UTC. `CONVERT_TZ` requires MariaDB's named-timezone tables to be loaded (confirmed present on the production instance); queries that don't group or label by day/hour don't need it, since every other timestamp comparison in this file is a plain UTC-to-UTC instant comparison.

**Field-formatting convention.** Set Grafana's field unit per column, per category, rather than leaving raw numbers unformatted:

- Cost columns already converted to pounds (`cost_gbp`, `*_cost_gbp`) → Grafana's currency (GBP, £) unit (`currencyGBP`).
- Rate columns still in pence/kWh (`rate_pence_per_kwh`, `rate`, etc.) → a custom unit of `p/kwh` (lowercase — this is the exact string the live Agile Prices panel uses, corrected from an earlier `p/kw` typo; Grafana custom unit strings are compared verbatim, so use this exact casing rather than `p/kWh` if adding the unit to any other panel) — these are deliberately *not* divided by 100, unlike the cost columns above, so don't apply the GBP unit to them.
- Energy columns (`*_kwh`, `est_kwh`) → a custom unit of `kWh` (`kwatth`).
- Percentage-change columns → Grafana's percent unit.

## Row 1 — Cost Summary

### Yesterday's Cost (Electricity) — timeseries, id 1

**Redesigned from a Stat panel to a genuine Timeseries.** Previously this was a Stat panel (`Graph mode: Area`, `Calcs: Last (not null)`) paired with a separate "As Of" companion panel just to show which date the reducer had landed on — necessary because a Stat panel's big number has no inherent date context. Now that it's a real Timeseries, the date is visible directly (axis/tooltip), so the **As Of panel (former id 11) has been removed entirely** rather than fixed further. `timeFrom: 45d` (panel-level override, independent of the dashboard's shared `-3h`/`+48h` range). `noValue: "0"`.

Thresholds changed to match the same blue/green/yellow/orange/red band style used elsewhere on this dashboard (Load Shift Efficiency, Cheapest Time Window): blue below £1, green from £1, yellow from £3, orange from £4, red from £5 (previously just green/amber/red at £3/£5). `min: -1` (was `0`), `max: 19`. `thresholdsStyle: area` renders the bands as a coloured background rather than just axis colouring. A field override forces the `cost_gbp` series line itself to a fixed purple colour, independent of the threshold-driven background.

The `product_rate` join fix from earlier (correlated subquery instead of the range-predicate form that measured at 88.9s elsewhere in this file) is unchanged and still in place.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(CONVERT_TZ(c.period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) AS time,
  ROUND((SUM(c.est_kwh * pr.unit_rate) + MAX(pr.standing_charge)) / 100, 2) AS cost_gbp
FROM consumption c
JOIN agreement a
  ON a.energy = c.energy
 AND c.period_from >= a.valid_from
 AND c.period_from < COALESCE(a.valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')
JOIN product_rate pr
  ON pr.id = (
    SELECT pr2.id FROM product_rate pr2
    WHERE pr2.product_code = a.product_code
      AND pr2.region = '${region}'
      AND pr2.valid_from <= c.period_from
    ORDER BY pr2.valid_from DESC
    LIMIT 1
  )
WHERE c.energy = 'E'
  AND c.period_from >= CURDATE() - INTERVAL 45 DAY
  AND c.period_from < CURDATE()
GROUP BY DATE(CONVERT_TZ(c.period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London'))
HAVING COUNT(*) = TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,
  CONVERT_TZ(CAST(time AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC'),
  CONVERT_TZ(CAST(time + INTERVAL 1 DAY AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC')
) / 30
ORDER BY time;
```

### Billing Period Progress ($billing_period_start → $billing_period_end) — bargauge, id 2

Title interpolates the `${billing_period_start}`/`${billing_period_end}` dashboard variables directly — this is what replaced the separate "Current Billing Period" table panel from earlier drafts of this dashboard. `Display mode: LCD`, `Value mode: Color`, reduced with `Calcs: Max`. Field overrides rename `billing_period_cost_gbp` → "Current Spend" and `projected_cost_gbp` → "Projected Spend". Thresholds: green / yellow (£60) / semi-dark-orange (£80) / dark-red (£100). Has a `configFromData` transformation that derives the gauge's max from `billing_period_cost_gbp` via a `max` reducer, followed by `filterFieldsByName`.

```sql
SELECT actual_cost_to_date AS billing_period_cost_gbp, projected_total_cost AS projected_cost_gbp
FROM cost_forecast
ORDER BY computed_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Row 2 — Electricity

### Latest Consumption — timeseries, id 4

Merges what earlier drafts of this dashboard had as two separate panels (Half-hourly Consumption and Half-hourly Cost) into one dual-axis chart. Query A (`est_kwh`, left axis, `kWh`) is a filled line (blue, high fill opacity) rather than a true bar-draw style. Query B (`cost_gbp`, right axis via a `byFrameRefID: B` override, `currencyGBP`, dark-red, zero fill — line only) overlays cost on a secondary axis. `timeFrom: 48h` pins this panel to a fixed 48-hour window independent of the dashboard's shared `-3h`/`+48h` range, even though the queries also use `$__timeFilter` internally.

```sql
-- Query A
SELECT period_from AS time, est_kwh
FROM consumption
WHERE energy = 'E'
  AND $__timeFilter(period_from)
ORDER BY period_from;

-- Query B
SELECT
  c.period_from AS time,
  ROUND(c.est_kwh * pr.unit_rate / 100, 4) AS cost_gbp
FROM consumption c
JOIN agreement a
  ON a.energy = c.energy
 AND c.period_from >= a.valid_from
 AND c.period_from < COALESCE(a.valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')
JOIN product_rate pr
  ON pr.id = (
    SELECT pr2.id FROM product_rate pr2
    WHERE pr2.product_code = a.product_code
      AND pr2.region = '${region}'
      AND pr2.valid_from <= c.period_from
    ORDER BY pr2.valid_from DESC
    LIMIT 1
  )
WHERE c.energy = 'E'
  AND $__timeFilter(c.period_from)
ORDER BY c.period_from;
```

**Fixed**: Query B previously used the plain range-predicate join against `product_rate` — the same 88.9s-class pattern already fixed on Yesterday's Cost. Rewritten to the correlated-subquery form used everywhere else.

### Agile Prices: Today/Tomorrow (Actual + Forecast) — timeseries, id 3

No panel-level time override — relies entirely on the dashboard's shared `now-3h` to `now+48h` range for its lookahead (see the dashboard-level time range note at the top of this file). Threshold *lines* (not fill) at the exact price bands used elsewhere on this dashboard: light-blue below £0, green from £0, yellow from £10p, semi-dark-orange from £20p, red from £25p — same bands as the Cheapest Time Window table's colour coding below, applied here as reference lines rather than cell colours. Unit is `p/kwh` (see the field-formatting convention note above).

```sql
SELECT valid_from AS time, unit_rate AS rate_pence_per_kwh, 'actual' AS series
FROM product_rate
WHERE product_code = (
  SELECT product_code FROM agreement
  WHERE energy = 'E'
    AND valid_from <= NOW()
    AND NOW() < COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')
  ORDER BY valid_from DESC LIMIT 1
)
AND region = '${region}'
AND valid_from >= CURDATE()

UNION ALL

SELECT period_from AS time, forecast_unit_rate AS rate_pence_per_kwh, 'forecast' AS series
FROM agile_forecast
WHERE region = '${region}'
  AND period_from >= NOW()
ORDER BY time;
```

### Load Shift Efficiency — timeseries, id 5

Replaces the two-line "p/kWh Efficiency vs Day's Avg Rate" panel from earlier drafts with a single derived percentage: how much cheaper your actual weighted-average rate is than the day's flat average rate, i.e. how well consumption is shifted toward cheap half-hours. Positive = shifted toward cheap hours; negative = shifted toward expensive ones. `timeFrom: 45d`. Thresholds: dark-red below 0%, green from 0%, blue from 20%. `min: -50`, `max: 51`.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(CONVERT_TZ(c.period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) AS time,
  ROUND(
    (AVG(pr.unit_rate) - (SUM(c.est_kwh * pr.unit_rate) / NULLIF(SUM(c.est_kwh), 0)))
      / NULLIF(AVG(pr.unit_rate), 0) * 100,
    2
  ) AS load_shift_efficiency_pct
FROM consumption c
JOIN agreement a
  ON a.energy = c.energy
 AND c.period_from >= a.valid_from
 AND c.period_from < COALESCE(a.valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')
JOIN product_rate pr
  ON pr.id = (
    SELECT pr2.id FROM product_rate pr2
    WHERE pr2.product_code = a.product_code
      AND pr2.region = '${region}'
      AND pr2.valid_from <= c.period_from
    ORDER BY pr2.valid_from DESC
    LIMIT 1
  )
WHERE c.energy = 'E'
  AND c.period_from >= NOW() - INTERVAL 45 DAY
GROUP BY DATE(CONVERT_TZ(c.period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London'))
HAVING COUNT(*) = TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,
  CONVERT_TZ(CAST(time AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC'),
  CONVERT_TZ(CAST(time + INTERVAL 1 DAY AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC')
) / 30
ORDER BY time;
```

### Average Consumption Per Day — barchart, id 6

Same query as earlier drafts' "Day-of-Week Average Consumption", renamed. `timeFrom: 45d`.

```sql
SELECT
  DAYNAME(d) AS day_of_week,
  ROUND(AVG(daily_kwh), 3) AS avg_kwh
FROM (
  SELECT DATE(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) AS d, SUM(est_kwh) AS daily_kwh
  FROM consumption
  WHERE energy = 'E'
    AND period_from >= NOW() - INTERVAL 45 DAY
  GROUP BY DATE(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London'))
  HAVING COUNT(*) = TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,
    CONVERT_TZ(CAST(d AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC'),
    CONVERT_TZ(CAST(d + INTERVAL 1 DAY AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC')
  ) / 30
) daily
GROUP BY DAYNAME(d)
ORDER BY FIELD(DAYNAME(d), 'Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday');
```

### Cheapest Time Window — table, id 13

**No panel title** — cleared intentionally (see the "remove a panel title" note in project history); identifiable only by its field override renaming `window_size` → "Cheapest Time Window", and by the heading below.

4 rows (`1h`/`2h`/`3h`/`4h` block sizes) × 3 columns (`24hrs`/`3days`/`5days` lookahead horizons — the middle column was renamed from `72hrs` to `3days`, same underlying 3-day cutoff, just relabeled once the dashboard's own forward window settled at 48h rather than 72h), wide-format like the Heatmap below. `product_rate` only reliably covers ~1–2 days ahead (Octopus publishes Agile rates the evening before), so the 3-day/5-day columns fall back to `agile_forecast` for any half-hour beyond what's actually been published, preferring actual rates over forecast wherever both exist. A window only counts for a horizon if it fits entirely inside it. Colour-coding is baked into the cell text itself as an emoji (🔵/🟢/🟡/🟠/🔴) rather than via Grafana thresholds, since Table panels can't apply numeric threshold-based cell colouring to a field whose displayed value is a composed string (time + rate) — SQL-side colouring sidesteps that limitation entirely and is portable across Grafana versions. Bands: `<0` blue, `[0,10)` green, `[10,20)` yellow, `[20,25]` orange, `>25` red. Field override renames `window_size` → "Cheapest Time Window". Assumes no gaps in the half-hourly series (actual or forecast) — a missing slot shifts a window's average incorrectly. Ties (identical average rate) are broken arbitrarily by whichever row MariaDB returns first from `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1`.

```sql

  SELECT product_code FROM agreement

### Consumption Heatmap (Hour-by-Hour, Last 45 Days) — heatmap, id 12

Title restored — the earlier accidental reset to Grafana's "Panel Title" placeholder is fixed; the panel's `timeFrom`/`timeShift` fix and query were unaffected throughout.

`Calculate from data: Off` plus a wide time-series shape (first field time-typed, one column per weekday) — Grafana's native Heatmap panel renders this as a categorical hour × weekday grid with no upgrade or transform needed. `time` is anchored to `TIMESTAMP(CURDATE())` purely to satisfy the time-typing requirement; only the hour-of-day component is meaningful. `timeFrom: "now/d"` + `timeShift: "0d/d"` pins the X axis to exactly today's 00:00–23:59, invariant of what time it actually is when the dashboard is viewed — the combination of both fields together is required; `timeFrom` alone always hardcodes the panel's end to literal "now", which is why this needed the two-field form rather than a single override. `period_from >= NOW() - INTERVAL 45 DAY`, not 90, per the retention-window cap above. `Y-Axis → Reverse: true` (Monday renders at the top). Field override applies the `kWh` custom unit via `cellValues.unit`.

```sql
SELECT
  TIMESTAMP(CURDATE()) + INTERVAL HOUR(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) HOUR AS time,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Monday'    THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Monday`,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Tuesday'   THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Tuesday`,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Wednesday' THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Wednesday`,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Thursday'  THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Thursday`,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Friday'    THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Friday`,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Saturday'  THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Saturday`,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) = 'Sunday'    THEN est_kwh END), 4) AS `Sunday`
FROM consumption
WHERE energy = 'E'
  AND period_from >= NOW() - INTERVAL 45 DAY
GROUP BY HOUR(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London'))
ORDER BY time;
```

### Daily Average Cost (Rolling 7-Day Window) — timeseries, id 8

Same query as earlier drafts' "Daily Average Cost — 7-Day Rolling Average, 45 Days", renamed. `timeFrom: 45d`. Thresholds match the blue/green/yellow/orange/red band style: blue below £1, green from £1 (moved from £2), yellow from £3, orange from £4, red from £5. `min: -1` (was `0`).

```sql
SELECT
  d AS time,
  ROUND(AVG(daily_cost) OVER (ORDER BY d ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS rolling_avg_cost_gbp
FROM (
  SELECT
    DATE(CONVERT_TZ(c.period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) AS d,
    (SUM(c.est_kwh * pr.unit_rate) + MAX(pr.standing_charge)) / 100 AS daily_cost
  FROM consumption c
  JOIN agreement a
    ON a.energy = c.energy
   AND c.period_from >= a.valid_from
   AND c.period_from < COALESCE(a.valid_to, '9999-12-31 23:59:59')
  JOIN product_rate pr
    ON pr.id = (
      SELECT pr2.id FROM product_rate pr2
      WHERE pr2.product_code = a.product_code
        AND pr2.region = '${region}'
        AND pr2.valid_from <= c.period_from
      ORDER BY pr2.valid_from DESC
      LIMIT 1
    )
  WHERE c.energy = 'E'
    AND c.period_from >= NOW() - INTERVAL 45 DAY
  GROUP BY DATE(CONVERT_TZ(c.period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London'))
  HAVING COUNT(*) = TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,
    CONVERT_TZ(CAST(d AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC'),
    CONVERT_TZ(CAST(d + INTERVAL 1 DAY AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC')
  ) / 30
) daily
ORDER BY d;
```

### Daily Average Usage (Rolling 7-Day Window) — timeseries, id 7

Same query as earlier drafts' "Daily Average Usage — 7-Day Rolling Average, 45 Days", renamed. `timeFrom: 45d`.

```sql
SELECT
  d AS time,
  ROUND(AVG(daily_kwh) OVER (ORDER BY d ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 3) AS rolling_avg_kwh
FROM (
  SELECT DATE(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London')) AS d, SUM(est_kwh) AS daily_kwh
  FROM consumption
  WHERE energy = 'E'
    AND period_from >= NOW() - INTERVAL 45 DAY
  GROUP BY DATE(CONVERT_TZ(period_from, 'UTC', 'Europe/London'))
  HAVING COUNT(*) = TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,
    CONVERT_TZ(CAST(d AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC'),
    CONVERT_TZ(CAST(d + INTERVAL 1 DAY AS DATETIME), 'Europe/London', 'UTC')
  ) / 30
) daily
ORDER BY d;
```

## Row 4 — Yearly Comparison

Reads from `daily_consumption_summary`, exempt from the 45-day retention cap above. Electricity only — the gas variants of both panels documented in earlier drafts of this file are not present in the current dashboard (see the callout below).

### Monthly Total Consumption — timeseries, id 9

`timeFrom: 365d`. Legend now shown (`showLegend: true`, previously hidden). Anchored to the first of the month 11 months ago via date arithmetic (`DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL DAYOFMONTH(date) - 1 DAY)`), not `DATE_FORMAT(...)`, so `time` stays a real `DATE`-typed column rather than a string.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL DAYOFMONTH(date) - 1 DAY) AS time,
  SUM(total_kwh) AS monthly_kwh
FROM daily_consumption_summary
WHERE energy = 'E'
  AND date >= DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE() - INTERVAL 11 MONTH, '%Y-%m-01')
GROUP BY DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL DAYOFMONTH(date) - 1 DAY)
ORDER BY time;
```

### Consumption Year-on-Year Percentage Change — timeseries, id 10

`timeFrom: 365d`. Groups by ISO week (`YEARWEEK(date, 3)`) and compares each week against the same ISO week one year prior, with a week-53 fallback and a completeness guard excluding any week without all 7 days present. Field overrides rename `yoy_pct_change` → "Week-by-Week Percentage Change" and `yoy_pct_change_4wk_avg` → "Rolling Average" (rendered as a zero-fill yellow line). Legend: table mode, shown on the right (unlike most other panels on this dashboard, which hide their legend).

```sql
WITH weekly AS (
  SELECT YEARWEEK(date, 3) AS yearweek, SUM(total_kwh) AS weekly_kwh
  FROM daily_consumption_summary
  WHERE energy = 'E'
  GROUP BY YEARWEEK(date, 3)
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 7
),
target AS (
  SELECT
    yearweek,
    weekly_kwh AS this_year_kwh,
    CASE
      WHEN MOD(yearweek, 100) = 53
       AND (yearweek - 100) NOT IN (SELECT yearweek FROM weekly)
      THEN (yearweek - 100) - 1
      ELSE yearweek - 100
    END AS comparator_yearweek
  FROM weekly
  WHERE yearweek >= YEARWEEK(CURDATE() - INTERVAL 52 WEEK, 3)
)
SELECT
  STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(t.yearweek, ' Monday'), '%x%v %W') AS time,
  ROUND((t.this_year_kwh - c.weekly_kwh) / NULLIF(c.weekly_kwh, 0) * 100, 2) AS yoy_pct_change,
  ROUND(
    AVG((t.this_year_kwh - c.weekly_kwh) / NULLIF(c.weekly_kwh, 0) * 100)
      OVER (ORDER BY t.yearweek ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
    2
  ) AS yoy_pct_change_4wk_avg
FROM target t
LEFT JOIN weekly c ON c.yearweek = t.comparator_yearweek
ORDER BY t.yearweek;
```

## Panels documented in earlier drafts that are no longer on the dashboard

**Flagging rather than silently deleting the history** — worth confirming this is intentional next time the dashboard's touched:

- **Row 3 — Gas**: Gas Consumption and Gas Cost panels, plus the gas variants of Monthly Total Consumption and Year-on-Year Change. None appear in the current JSON export.
- **Row 5 — Health**: Last Successful Run per Job and AgilePredict/Kraken Reachability. Neither appears in the current JSON export.
- **Standing Charge vs Unit-Rate Cost Split** (stacked bar) and the old **Cheapest N-Hour Window Today/Tomorrow** table (superseded by the new Cheapest Time Window matrix above) — also absent.

If gas monitoring and the health-check panels are meant to still be live, they may exist on a different dashboard than the one exported here (`grafana/dashboard.json`, titled **"pi-desktop: octopus-energy"**).
